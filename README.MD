# The Perfect Android App
##### Used:
 - Clean + MVVM Architecture
 - Multi-Modular Project with Kotlin BuildSrc for managing Gradle
 - RxJava 2, RxKotlin, RxAndroid
 - Room ORM and Unit tests
 - Retrofit API Caching
 - JUnit, Mockito
 - Koin Dependency Injection (More readable code than Dagger and the community is moving towards it)
 - Loading and Error States Handled
##### Could be improved:
 - UI (concentrated on the architecture)
 - Espresso tests need to be added
